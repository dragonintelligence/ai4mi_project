Some of the 2D slices did not feature any segmentation. Otherwise, the most common feature is 2 small red circles in the middle of the scan. Some scans also feature very small blue or/and orange spots close to the red ones, or large green circles at the top. The same features can be better observed in the 3D viewer, but with different colors. The large green blobs are yellow, the 2 red circles in 3D view are blue tubes, the small blue dot is now a thin green tube, only orange tubes preserved their color. However, it is difficult to understand the meanings of these surfaces without medical knowledge.
